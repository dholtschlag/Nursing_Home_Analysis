## Read Nursing Home Rating tsv file into R environment.


```{r read_ratings}

rating <- read.table(file = 'Data/Nursing Home Rating.tsv', sep = '\t', 
                     header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                     colClasses = c('character', 'character', 'factor'))

provider <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Nursing Home Provider_Info.tsv', sep='\t',
                       header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
